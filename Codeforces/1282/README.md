# Codeforces Round #610 (Div. 2)
### [1282B1](https://codeforces.com/contest/1282/problem/B1)
### [1282B2](https://codeforces.com/contest/1282/problem/B2)
I solved both B1 and B2 with the same code, since they only vary at input constraints. The idea was from user [kartik800](https://codeforces.com/profile/kartik8800)'s  comment in the contest editorial [here](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/72461?locale=en#comment-567164)
