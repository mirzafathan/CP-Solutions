# Codeforces Round #736 (Div. 2)
## Solved Problems:
It didn't went well. Actually two of my submissions (I did submit for A,B, and C) are accepted in pretests (A and B). But after the contest, B was TLE at test case 15 which was foolish. I hope I learnt something. I upload code for D but it remains unsolved since it is still too hard for me right now.
