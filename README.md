# CP-Solutions
<br />
This repository stores my solutions for CP problems especially those in [Codeforces](https://www.codeforces.com).

I do this as a preparation for my coding test (in the future). <br />
Here's my Codeforces handle [mirzaalarsyad](https://codeforces.com/profile/mirzaalarsyad). <br />
Don't expect a thing, I am just 1135 (newbie) :D <br />

I am looking forward to improve! <br /> <br/>
P.S. Some codes here do not have an "Accepted" verdict. <br/>
